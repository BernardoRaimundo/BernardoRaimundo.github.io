<p>Portfolio management is crucial in the finance and investment sectors, providing significant benefits to both individual investors and institutions. 
Various mathematical models are employed by researchers to make informed decisions on investment allocation and management, optimizing the risk-return trade-off 
according to investor preferences and constraints. 
This study evaluates the effectiveness of various portfolio optimization techniques by incorporating short selling, often overlooked in existing research. 
We examine advanced methods, including Mean Variance Optimization (MVO), Global Minimum Variance (GMV), Maximum Diversification (MD), Risk Parity (RP), 
Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) and Equal Weighted Portfolio (EW). Employing historical data from seven commodity groups, we conduct one hundred portfolio
 simulations, assessing performance through metrics such as the Sharpe and Sortino ratio, downside deviation and maximum drawdown with the median performance 
 analysed over a six-month rolling window. Findings indicate that while MVO potentially increases returns, it also introduces greater volatility. GMV consistently
  exhibits stability and low risk, ideal for conservative strategies. MD and RP show moderate but resilient performance, and HRP, despite its innovation, 
  tends to be more volatile. Surprisingly, the EW strategy holds its ground against more complex approaches, providing a viable option for those valuing simplicity.
   This analysis highlights the importance of matching portfolio strategies with investor risk preferences, especially when integrating techniques
    like short selling.</p>
