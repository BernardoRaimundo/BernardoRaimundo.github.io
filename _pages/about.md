    <p>Hello! I’m Bernardo Raimundo, currently embarking on a PhD in Information Management specializing in Data Science at Nova IMS. I have a robust background in internal audit and risk management and have developed a strong passion for machine learning, with a special focus on its applications in finance.</p>
    <p>During my Master’s program, I dedicated my thesis to exploring the effectiveness of combined machine learning models in credit scoring methods. This work not only deepened my understanding of predictive analytics but also led to the publication of a scientific paper that highlights my contributions to advancing methodologies in the field.</p>
    <p>I am also privileged to teach data science courses at Nova IMS, staying actively engaged with both the academic community and the latest advancements in our field. My scientific interests are particularly geared towards Data Science for Finance, focusing on areas like portfolio optimization, risk management, and credit scoring.</p>
    <p>As I progress in my PhD, I am excited to explore further the intersections of machine learning and finance. My goal is to innovate and apply my skills in a challenging and dynamic environment, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in data science.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my website, where I share my publications, projects, and various coding endeavors related to these themes. I look forward to connecting with fellow researchers and practitioners who are equally passionate about advancing our understanding and application.</p>
